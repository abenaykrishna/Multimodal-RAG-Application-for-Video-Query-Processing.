# Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application

## Overview
This project implements a **Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to effectively handle user queries related to video uploads. By integrating advanced AI models and efficient database management, the system aims to provide intelligent, multimodal responses that enhance user interaction with diverse content types.

## Key Features
- **Multimodal Query Handling**: Processes user queries that include both text and visual inputs, such as video or image content.
- **Embedding and Inference Models**: Utilizes **BridgeTower** for embedding multimodal data and **LLaVA** for generating detailed, context-aware responses.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Employs **LanceDB** as the vector database for fast and accurate retrieval of relevant information.

## Architecture
The architecture of the system consists of several key components:

### Data Processing
- Ingests and processes video and image data from enterprise sources.
- Ensures secure data handling and sub-system instantiation for indexing.

### Embedding Model
- Utilizes **BridgeTower/BridgeTower-large** to generate embeddings for multimodal data.
- Embedding models encode both user queries and multimedia content into a unified vector space.

### Indexing and Retrieval
- Leverages **LanceDB** to store and manage vector embeddings for videos and images.
- Retrieves and ranks the most relevant content based on user queries.

### Prompt Processing and Inference
- Processes user queries along with retrieved data using the **LLaVA** model.
- Generates human-like responses based on the combined query and multimodal context.

### Post-Processing
- Finalizes and formats the response for user delivery.

## Dependencies
- **Python Version**: 3.8+
  
### Key Libraries:
- **LangChain**
- **BridgeTower**
- **LLaVA**
- **LanceDB**
